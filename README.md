Module 8 Journal and Project
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The client was The Gaming Room. They were working on a game called Draw It or Lost It for Android. The Gaming Room wanted to improve the software functionality and to expand to other platforms.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helps you keep your focus on the current task on hand, and, helps to decide on what tasks are important and which ones don't need a lot of time to focus on.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Recomendations were hard for me, sometimes it's really hard to give good reccomendations, as you kind of need to figure out how to make the program better in of itself too.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took the functionality of the game and helped split it up into different parts so that there would be less work and time spend expanding to other operating platforms. All while still keeping the game the same. Your client may be the one to ask you to do the work but it is the user's who truely control the product. If they don't trust the software or have problems with it then they won't use it and no more product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I put my focus on clear documentation and seperating game and game needs functionality to allow easier updates and maintenence.
