# CS-230 Project
In Module 8, I worked with The Gaming Room on their project, "Draw It or Lost It" for Android. The client aimed to enhance software functionality and expand to other platforms. I effectively organized tasks in the design document, prioritizing key elements during the coding process.

Reflecting on the experience, recommending improvements was challenging. Giving meaningful recommendations requires understanding how to enhance the program itself. I found the design document beneficial for maintaining focus and prioritizing tasks based on importance and time investment.

Addressing user needs was crucial; I segmented the game's functionality to streamline expansion to other platforms while preserving the core experience. Although clients usually handle most tasks, ensuring user control in the application is vital.

My software design approach centered on clear and concise code. I divided tasks into manageable components, creating a checklist for implementation and fixes. In the future, I plan to employ similar strategies for analyzing and designing software applications.
